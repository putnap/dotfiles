// Blueprint: an agent's Mermaid flowchart drawn natively in a pane.
//
// Colour means status only (working = in progress, done = finished, the rest
// neutral), from theme() tokens. Yellow is the work in progress: its nodes,
// the edge that leads into it and the edges inside it. While this pane has
// focus a dot runs through that part, one per line of work; otherwise nothing
// moves (a running dot keeps the whole window repainting: ~11% -> ~28% CPU).
// Click a node: its upstream and downstream
// flow stays lit. Edit mode (e): click a node, say what should change, and it
// goes to the agent in this tab as "In Blueprint I pointed at ...", the same
// request the terminal Blueprint sends. Drag or scroll to move, Ctrl/Cmd+scroll
// to zoom. The layout turns top-to-bottom when that fits the pane better.
//
// It runs as a pane (pane.split {mod: "blueprint"}) or as a side panel next to
// Files and Changes (props {panel: true}, see scripts/add-button.sh). As a
// panel it serves the tab on screen, and its dot runs while the pointer is on it.
//
// What it shows are the diagrams of the project the tab's terminal is in (its
// git checkout, so each worktree has its own), kept in the app's data folder
// by store.js: each *.mmd file there is one tab, redrawn when the agent saves
// it. With none yet, it offers the agents in the tab; picking one connects it
// and asks it to draw.
//
// Commands (keys.json or `herdr-app do blueprint.<name>`):
//   fit, zoom-in, zoom-out, zoom-100, export, clear, tab-1..9, select-<node id>,
//   edit, compose-<node id>, note-<text, _ for spaces>, send, cancel, target-<terminal>,
//   connect-<terminal>, pin, pane, new, refresh, close-tab

- Every box is a piece of the code, not a step of your task. Tie each box to it: \`%% code: <node id> <path>:<line>\`.
